## Build status

| Branch   | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Main     | #      |

## How to start building?

Well, first of all, you need some form of a development environment. I personally use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), but you can use whatever you want. 
So, since I use CLion, I will explain how to set it up in CLion.

### Setting up SDL2

First of all, you need to download the SDL2 development libraries. 
You can do this by going to it's Github repo [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest) and grab the devel minGW zip file, than dump the contents like the example version in the `./libs/SDL2` directory inside your project.

### Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues with regards to CMakes inability to find the SDL2 libraries, you probably need to add the `SLD2` directory to your `PATH` variable inside your OS (Operating System).
You could also inject the path into the CMakeLists.txt file, but I personally prefer to keep it out of there.
